# Abstract

In this assignment, an employer needed a random password generator that, upon clicking/pressing the button, would allow employees to specify, through a series of prompts, the desired length of their password, as well as whether it would include lower/upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters. The application would then run a series of functions in JavaScript and display a new password in the browser.
